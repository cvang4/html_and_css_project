            <h2>Video Games</h2>
            <p>Growing up as a kid video games has always been a fun hobby for me. I love all games including shooting games, real-time strategy, rpgs, and games that I can enjoy with everyone.</p>

            <P>I can be out on the lake, river, or pond all day fishing. I love being able to enjoy the outdoor scenery and weather. It's not always about the catch, but when they do bite the fight is fun!</P>

            <h2>Traveling</h2>
            <p>Prior to meeting my wife my interest for traveling was almost non-existent. My wife definitely brought out the spontaneous side of me and through traveling allowed me to realize that I was missing out on some of the most beautiful and adventurous experiences to be made. Food experiences are the biggest perks for me when traveling. We have much more to continue exploring, and honestly have only scratched the surface. A big one for my wife is to travel out of the country. Initially, we had planned for our first out of the country trip to be in 2019, but of course that was when the pandemic started. I still owe her an out of the country trip, so we are crossing fingers for that in the next year or two. </p>
